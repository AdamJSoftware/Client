Quick python client application for windows.

Works with the server program found in my other repository.

Very simple to use server which creates a network between all of your computers (that have the client program installed).

Automatically connects and disconnects while on server network

Allows to send, receive and backup files. 

Many more improvements will be coming soon. This is just the beta version.

Improvements to be made:
  - GUI
  - Password authentication
  - Local JSON server to keep track of computer activity + email notifications
  - General bug fixes
  - Open source plugins
  - More secure connections
  - Code clean-up
